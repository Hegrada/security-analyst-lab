# Threat Intelligence Log Parser - Dependencies
# ===============================================
# 
# This project uses only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required for core functionality.
#
# However, for enhanced functionality, you may optionally install:
#
# For faster HTTP requests:
# requests>=2.31.0
#
# For enhanced logging:
# colorlog>=6.7.0
#
# For YAML configuration support:
# PyYAML>=6.0
#
# For IPv6 address validation (more robust than stdlib):
# ipaddress>=1.0.0
#
# For concurrent API queries (async support):
# aiohttp>=3.9.0
#
# =============================================================================
# Production Requirements (Standard Library Only)
# =============================================================================
# Python 3.8+ is required.
# All dependencies below are part of the Python standard library:
#
# - argparse      : Command-line argument parsing
# - dataclasses   : Data class decorators (Python 3.7+)
# - datetime      : Date and time handling
# - hashlib       : Cryptographic hashing
# - json          : JSON encoding/decoding
# - logging       : Logging framework
# - re            : Regular expressions
# - threading     : Thread-based parallelism
# - time          : Time-related functions
# - typing        : Type hints support
# - urllib.parse  : URL parsing
# - urllib.request: URL opening and reading
# - pathlib       : Object-oriented filesystem paths
# - collections   : Specialized container datatypes
# =============================================================================

# This file is intentionally minimal since no external packages are required.
# The script works out-of-the-box with a standard Python 3 installation.
